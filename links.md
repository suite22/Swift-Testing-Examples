- [Better Unit Testing with Swift by Joe Masilotti](http://masilotti.com/better-swift-unit-testing/)
	- "With the release of Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7 I though it was a great time to try writing my unit tests using only Apple's XCTest framework. That's right, no dependencies, no BDD, and no matchers. Here are some concepts that I've picked up over the past couple of months of "real-world" unit testing in Swift. I wish I knew these from the beginning, but hopefully they can help spark some light with seasoned Swift testers too."
